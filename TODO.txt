Notes about savegames:

* TIC-80 web seems broken if 'saveid:' is present. Works if absent.
* itch.io export seems to ignore 'saveid:'.
* HOWEVER, installed TIC-80 playing via 'surf' works with 'saveid:'
           installed TIC-80 manual cart add works with 'saveid:'

Solution:
 
  TIC-80 web: export without saveid and hope to not update?
     -> no, not a good idea because people can download
        the cart

  itch.io: export with saveid, but it won't work; just hope
     to not update it :(

  TIC-80 .tic file: use WITH saveid (people can add it with the 'add' command)
  Win/MacOSX/Linux: export WITH saveid
